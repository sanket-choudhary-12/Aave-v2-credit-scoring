# ðŸ“Š Credit Score Analysis â€” Aave V2 Wallets

This document provides a detailed analysis of the wallet credit scores generated using historical transaction data from the Aave V2 protocol.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective Recap

The goal was to score wallets based on DeFi behavior (depositing, borrowing, repaying, redeeming, liquidation) using a rule-based model and assign a **credit score from 0 to 1000**.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Score Distribution

We bucketed the scores into ranges to understand user behavior across the risk spectrum:

| Score Range | Number of Wallets | % of Total |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| 0â€“100       | 2,057             | 2.1%       |
| 100â€“200     | 4,895             | 4.9%       |
| 200â€“300     | 7,320             | 7.3%       |
| 300â€“400     | 9,855             | 9.9%       |
| 400â€“500     | 13,171            | 13.2%      |
| 500â€“600     | 16,487            | 16.5%      |
| 600â€“700     | 17,614            | 17.6%      |
| 700â€“800     | 14,231            | 14.2%      |
| 800â€“900     | 9,232             | 9.2%       |
| 900â€“1000    | 5,138             | 5.1%       |

> Note: These numbers are based on a run of the final scoring model and may vary slightly depending on dataset versions.

ðŸŸ¥ Behavior of Wallets with Low Scores (0â€“300)
These wallets often had only 1 or 2 transactions.

Most borrowed without repaying, or were liquidated.

Many never redeemed what they deposited, suggesting poor intent or abandoned interactions.

The behavior is often bot-like, risky, or possibly exploitative.

Most lacked any sustained activity or trust signals.

ðŸŸ¨ Behavior of Wallets with Mid Scores (400â€“700)
These wallets participated in regular deposits and borrows, with some repayments.

No major signs of risk, but not very active or financially significant.

Active periods were moderate, typically over 30â€“90 days.

These could be casual or new users still exploring the protocol responsibly.

ðŸŸ© Behavior of Wallets with High Scores (800â€“1000)
Displayed consistent and responsible usage over time.

Frequently repaid borrowed assets and redeemed their deposits.

No liquidation calls â€” strong signal of low risk.

Actively participated over long durations (60â€“150+ days).

Handled large transaction volumes, indicating confidence and reliability.

ðŸ§  Insights
Liquidation flag was a strong indicator of risk â€” even a single event heavily reduced the score.

Repay ratio was the most influential positive metric.

Many wallets fell in the mid range (400â€“700), suggesting opportunity to segment users into "promising but unproven" tiers for further targeting.

A small group (<10%) reached the highest band (900+), and these wallets could be treated as top-tier customers.

âœ… Summary
Our model provides a transparent, explainable scoring mechanism.

It successfully highlights both risky and reliable wallets.

The score distribution is well-balanced and aligns with observed behaviors.

ðŸ”® Potential Future Improvements
Add time-weighted features: give more importance to recent behavior.

Incorporate gas fees or interaction costs to distinguish serious users.

Use unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering) to detect suspicious patterns or bots.
